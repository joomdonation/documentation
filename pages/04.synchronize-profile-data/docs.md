Membership Pro has plugins to allow you to synscronize subscriber's data which is stored in Membership Pro with **Joomla User Profile** and third party extensions. Right now, the folllowing third party extensions are supported: **Community Builder**, **Jomsocial**, **Jomsocial**, **EasyProfile**.

1. When users sign up in Membership Pro, if he has an existing account, the data stored in his profile (**Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile**), the data from his profile will be used to fill-in subscription form automatically so that he won't have to type the information again. If he changes data of any fields on subscription form, the changed will be synchronized back to his profile (**Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile**)
2. When users sign up in Membership Pro, if he doesn't have an existing account (**Joomla account or third party extensions account**), Membership Pro will create a Joomla account for him and update the profile (**Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile**) with the data which subscriber entered on subscription form.
3. When subscriber access to his profile page in Membership Pro and update his profile data, the changes will be updated to **Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile**.
4. **The integration is one way only**. That means the change in Membership Pro will be synchronized to **Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile** but the changes from Joomla User Profile or third party extensions profile won't be updated back to Membership Pro. Maybe in the future, we will have two ways integration, but at the time of this writing, it is not supported.
